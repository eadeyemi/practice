C elegans is a very practical model for aging studies

the animal has a very comparable amount of genes with humans even though 
it has a significantly smaller genome

C.elegans (Caenorhabditis elegans) is a free-living, transparent nematode 
(roundworm), about 1 mm in length, which naturally lives in temperate soil 
environments. 
C. elegans is a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite that has a temperature sensitive
life span. They are also inexpensive to maintain and can be grown in 
vast quantities in the lab. Due to these characteristics, C. elegans has 
emerged as one of the premiere model systems for aging.
